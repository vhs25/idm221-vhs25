        <p>In my "Maker Workshop" class, I designed, programmed and built a sweat sensor. This device is meant to detect when a hand is sweaty and trigger both a light and a fan to turn on. I used a Grove GSR sensor to detect a person's degree of sweatiness by reading the conductivity levels of their fingers. The number output was then used to turn on/off the 5V Mini Fan and LED. </p>

        <p>I used felt to fashion all of the pieces into a wearable bracelet, with flowers stitched into the outer casing. The sensor, fan, LED and coin cell battery holder were all wired to an Adafruit Gemma board with conductive thread. </p>
