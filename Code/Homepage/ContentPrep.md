## Site 1 - MC Long's Portfolio
https://marycatelong.wordpress.com

I chose this site because this is one of the first online portfolios I remember looking at. I like this site as an example for both its content and minimalist design. Of course, I understand that this is a wordpress template, but I think this presents a good foundation for what would be expected in a portfolio site. 

I also appreciate how laid back MC's writing feels. It feels more personal than what a strictly professional tone would be. I like the use of slightly bolded fonts, and the way the template leaves room to breathe inbetween elements. One thing I don't like is how much space the header photo takes up on the web/computer layout. The mobile version is far more reasonable. Also, I could always do without ads. 

## Site 2 - Instagram

I think Instagram is a nice example of how to deesign photo-heavy content. For the portfolio section of my site, the structure of the photos will be important.

On Instagram, I like its grid structure, using somwhat generous white space as a border betweeen photos. I also like its circular icons at the top of the profile, and the thin bar that lets you navigate to diffrent profile pages. Instagram is very simplified, using white space and bold font to separate different types of content. I could see myself drawing inspiration from the "bio" format for my own site.

## Site 3 - Package Free Shop

In my opinion, this site is really well done. It flows well, both in layout, organization, and in its animations. Classic elements, like overlaying text on photos and using rectangle icons to represent buttons are done really well, probably due to the photo quality and the relatively simple aesthetic of the page. The way this site fills the screen with each section of the home page keeps the viewer's focus on 1-2 sections at a time, which I like a lot. Despite filling the screen, limiting the amount of content that appears at once keeps things from feeling cramped and overwhelming. Also the use of blocked pastel colors break up the space keeps the scroll interesting.

## About Me
My name is Victoria Stauffer. I am a second-year student at Drexel University, enrolled in the Interactive Digital Media program.  So far my interests for this major lie in creative problem solving and in the psychological research contributing to UI and UX Design.

Outside of this major I am very interested in environmentalism and sustainable living, as well as politics from a sociological perspective. I still have a lot to learn, but I sometimes feel that I am being drawn toward a career that will involve environmental activism. 

As hobbies, I love to draw and paint. I have been practicing fine art since high school and it is one of the things that drew me to the IDM program. I also enjoy staying active with Yoga and Swing Dancing. Jazz music is some of my favorite music, and I believe that saxaphones descended straight from the heavens. 

One of my favorite challenges is finding the most ridiculous thing in a thrift store and buying it. I love wearing bright colors and patterns and I'm often drawn to vintage, feminine fashion. 

I always feel that it's a challenge to describe yourself, so here are some random tidbits you can frame me with: 
- My friends have described me as "awkward, but in an endearing way." 
- I love peanut butter - crunchy and smooth
- My personal motto is "organized chaos," but with an emphasis on organized.
