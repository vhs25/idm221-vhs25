    <h1>The Sweat Sensor</h1>
    <p>
        In my "Maker Workshop" class, I designed, developed and built a sweat sensor. This device is meant to detect when a hand is sweaty and trigger both a light and a fan to turn on. I used a Grove GSR sensor to detect a person's degree of sweatiness by reading the conductivity levels of their fingers. The number output was then used to turn on/off the 5V Mini Fan and LED.
