        <p>ASMRtistry is a time lapse video I created with Ben Schenerman. In it you watch as we stipple paint an image of curly hair in two color schemes: Warm Analogous and Cool Analogous. Ben composed the calming music and ASMR sounds to accompany the video and create a relaxing, maybe even tingly experience. </p>
